# Python Sorting Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms written in Python

## Algorithms
1. **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order

2. **Merge Sort**: A divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges the sorted halves

3. **Quick Sort**: Another divide and conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot

## How to Use
Each sorting algorithm is implemented in a separate Python script:

- `bubbleSort.py`
- `mergeSort.py`
- `quickSort.py`

Feel free to explore the scripts, use them in your projects, or modify them!
