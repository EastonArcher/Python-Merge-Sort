# Python Sort Algorithms

Welcome to the Python Sort Algorithms repository! This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms written in Python. Whether you're learning about sorting algorithms or looking for efficient implementations, this repository has you covered.

## Algorithms Included

1. **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

2. **Merge Sort**: A divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges the sorted halves.

3. **Quick Sort**: Another divide and conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

## How to Use

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in a separate Python script:

- `bubbleSort.py`
- `mergeSort.py`
- `quickSort.py`

Feel free to explore the scripts, use them in your projects, or modify them according to your requirements.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements, bug fixes, or additional sorting algorithms you'd like to add, please feel free to open a pull request.
